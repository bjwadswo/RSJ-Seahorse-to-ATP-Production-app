    "## Extracting ATP production from standard Wave software output XLSX file\n",
    "251106 written by Brennan Wadsworth\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook is going to be the blueprint for the py file to be associated with the py2app app. Thus it will have a few key differences from the notebook version of the calculator:\n",
    "    - The GUI will include a file selector, so that we don't need to worry about finding the excel file internally in the code\n",
    "    - Similarly, we will have an entry widget for stating which injection oligomycin and rot/aa are so that the user does not need to alter the excel file\n",
    "\n",
    "- As before, the purpose of this script is to take the pH readings, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) values, and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) values in order to calculate the ATP production in pmol/min specific to glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This allows for comparison of OCR and ECAR in equivalent units.\n",
    "- The protocol to produce the required data is described in the Randall Johnson Laboratory SOP \"KI_SOP_Seahorse for ATP Production Calculation\", which is based on the publication from Desousa et al. (2023) EMBO Reports 24(10).\n",
    "\n",
    "- This script expects the standard Wave software output file with the following sheet names: Assay Configuration, Rate, Rate (columns), Rate (plates), Raw, Calibration, and Operation Log. The script will use the \"Assay Configuration\", \"Rate\", and \"Raw\" sheets for data collection, so it is best for these to not be modified. \n"

    "### Notes on assumptions for the protocol used\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard protocol associated with this assay is media supplemented with glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate for the experimental and background correction wells. It is required that these wells are treated with oligomycin and Rotenone+Antimycin A, the other injections do not matter.\n",
    "    - This script will assume that whatever measurements precede the oligomycin injection represents \"basal\" metabolism\n",
    "- The script will scan the Assay Configuration sheet to look for the acid treatment wells. The standard name for these wells should be \"Buffering Power H2SO4\" or \"Buffering Power HCl\", but the script will check for anything with H2SO4, HCL, acid, or buffer in the name and assign those wells to the buffering power calculation. If none are found a standard buffering power value will be assumed.\n",
    "- The script will scan the Assay Configuration sheet and find groups and organize the resultant data according to groups, with a calculation made for each well."
